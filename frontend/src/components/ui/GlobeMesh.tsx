/**
 * Globe — a wobbling, flickering ball of points inside a shimmering wireframe
 * cage that lights up and fills in under the pointer.
 *
 * Three draws share one rotation:
 *
 *   points — the Fibonacci sphere, each point carrying only a direction and a
 *            seed. Its radius, size and colour are derived in the vertex shader
 *            from those plus the clock, so several thousand cost one draw call
 *            and nothing is written per frame.
 *   cage   — the edges of a subdivided icosahedron at a larger radius, with a
 *            shimmer that either runs the length of each edge on its own
 *            schedule or crosses the whole ball as one band.
 *   panels — the faces of that same icosahedron, invisible until the pointer
 *            arrives, then filling in brightest where it is pointing.
 *
 * The cage's shimmer comes in two styles and only ever one at a time. Edge
 * runs a head down each wire on that wire's own schedule; Sweep passes a single
 * band across the whole ball at a set angle. Running both at once was tried and
 * left nothing still enough to read either against — so they are weights that
 * sum to one in the shader, not a branch, which keeps it to a single path.
 *
 * The pointer is turned into a *direction on the sphere*, not a screen
 * position: its ray is intersected with the ball, and the hit is pushed back
 * through the group's rotation into object space. That is what lets a lit panel
 * stay on the same face as the globe turns. Comparing screen positions instead
 * makes the highlight sit still while the geometry slides underneath it.
 *
 * Everything draws additively with no depth test, so the far side shows through
 * the near side. Facing alone dims the back — a depth-sorted cloud flickers as
 * points swap order, and hiding the far side entirely leaves a flat disc of
 * dots with no interior.
